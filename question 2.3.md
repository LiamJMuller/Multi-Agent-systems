For the scenario given, the communication medium I would select to use is wireless radio frequency (RF) communication. This would be suitable for distributed agents in space because RF supports long range and low-power transmissions. There are alternatives that could be used, optical (lasers), for high-bandwidth but are line-of-sight limited. For this topolgy, RF is more robust and more suited. 

Requirements:
- Reliability: error correcting codes and acknowledgements to ahndle space interferences.
- Bandwidth: At least 1Mbps for image exchanges, this is also considering compressed sizes.
- Latency: Less than a second per hop for real-time consensus. Requirement: Prioritise small metadata packets over full images.
- Security: Encryption, demonstrated on 2.4. Requirement: Authenticate enighbours to prevent sppefing.
Power efficiency: Low-duty cycle transmission. Requirements: Agents only communicate when necessary, event-triggered.
Topology awareness: Use routing protocols like AODV for multi-hpo if needed, but direct niehgbour links are sufficient. 
- Interoperability: Standard protocols like IEEE 802.12.4 for RF. Requirement: Compatible with image formats and metadata.
